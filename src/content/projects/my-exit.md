## Introduction

My Exit is a UK-based firm specializing in acquiring and scaling small to medium-sized businesses with revenues between £2M and £10M. They offer two distinct pathways for business owners: immediate acquisition at market value or a future sale option at double the current valuation.

---

## Challenge

Many small businesses struggle to achieve successful exits due to:

1.  **Low Transaction Success Rate**: 80% of companies with less than £10M turnover never sell.
2.  **Aborted Transactions**: Owners waste time and money on unsuccessful deals.
3.  **Misaligned Incentives**: Brokers and competitors may not prioritize the owner's legacy or employee protection.
4.  **Valuation Maximization**: Ensuring the business is valued appropriately and its potential is fully realized.

---

## Solution

My Exit provides two strategic solutions:

1.  **Immediate Sale at Market Value**:

    - My Exit acquires 100% of the business at its current market value.
    - A 6-12 month handover period is included for a smooth transition.

2.  **Future Sale at Double the Value**:
    - My Exit purchases a small stake in the business upfront.
    - They secure an option to buy the remaining shares later at double the initial valuation.
    - No handover is required post-sale, offering flexibility for the owner.
